## Donation Campaign

#### Added 3 Project features

- Donation Card Selection:
  Users can select the donation cards they are      interested in by clicking on the "Donate Card."

  Donation Page:
  When a user clicks on a "Donate Card," they are   redirected to a different route/page named "Donation."

  Show Details:
  On the "Donation" page, users can click on a "Show Details" button to view more information about the selected donation card.


- Show All Button:
  Users can click the "Show All" button in the dynamic section.

  Display Donated Cards:
  Clicking the "Show All" button will display all the donated cards that the user has added.

  Hide Button Conditions:

  If the user has added 4 or fewer cards, the "Show   All" button will be hidden.
  If the user has already shown all the cards, the "Show All" button will be hidden too.

- Pie Chart Functionality:
  The pie chart displays two categories of data: "Total Donation" and "Your Donation."

  User-Friendly Understanding:
  Users can easily understand their donation percentage within the pie chart, which motivates them to make more donations in the future.
